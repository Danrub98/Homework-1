# Homework-1
This website was modified to fit the requirement of accessibility, this subject is really important, because by making this changes, not only will the page be more likely to be found by the SEO, but also, we are making the navigation easier for people with disabilities. 

The changes applied to the website where the following:
* The website title was modified to a more efective description, making it easir for people to access.
* The website code was divided in it's corresponding sections, by doing this, the accessibility it more diverse, because screen readers can
detect which website they're accessing.
* The CSS code was commented, to make it easier for future programers to analize the changes, and how the rules are applied.
* The code was displayed in a better order, to make it easier to new programers to read it and apply the corresponding changes.
* To the images, I added an "alt" text, in case the screen reader needs to be implemented, the user can imagine what the image is about and have a full access to the website.

While being a web-developer, the accessibility needs to be a core asset while building the website, because we need to understand the necessities of the user, and grant them access to the website by the accesibility options integrated in the comnputer.

With the changes made, the website should be user friendly, no matter how the access the website, and the user would be able to understand what is happening in the website.
